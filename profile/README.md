# ETS NextGen

This is the github account which was created for the ETS Center for Next Generation Psychometrics and Data Science. This center no longer exists, and this repository has changed ownership / maintainership / use several times. It was created for an internal training course on git / github.

At the time of creation, it was approved for use for things which are not confidential or proprietary, but which also aren't intended to be high-visibility. For example:

* Open-science (e.g. scripts associated with publications)
* Early research prototyping
* Low-key collaborations with external partners
* ... and similar

In other words, it was designed as a place for low-stakes, half-baked projects which have not reached the level of maturity to be placed in the main ETS github account. 

If projects reach a high level of maturity, and are intended for broader dissemination, or otherwise are intended to be high-visibility, they should move to the main, branded [ETS github account](https://github.com/EducationalTestingService). Internal projects, or ones which manage proprietary / confidential data should use the internal gitlab server.
